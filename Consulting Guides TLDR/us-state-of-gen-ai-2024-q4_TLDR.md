## Key Concepts & Frameworks

*   **Generative AI (GenAI):** AI that, in response to a query, can create new text, images, video, and other assets. These systems interact with humans and are trained on datasets that range in size and quality from Small Language Models (SLMs) to Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **AI agents:** Software systems capable of completing complex tasks and meeting objectives with little or no human intervention, possessing the agency to act independently, plan, and execute actions to achieve a specified goal.
*   **Agentic AI:** The vision for autonomous AI agents to consistently and reliably execute assigned tasks by acquiring and processing multimodal data, utilizing various tools, coordinating with other AI agents, and learning from past experiences. It is considered the next logical step for GenAI, increasing AI's responsibility and autonomy.
*   **"Now decides next"**: A framework highlighting that current actions and investments in GenAI will decisively impact a company's future success with the technology.
*   **AI Flywheel:** Refers to the self-reinforcing acceleration of AI capabilities and adoption, described as the greatest secular shift of this quarter century, implying **Moore’s Law** is effectively dead in this context.

## Notable Quotes

*   "Don’t lose focus. Stay curious, and challenge the orthodoxies of your organizations. GenAI and AI broadly is our reality—it’s not going away. While there are more questions than answers, but to stay in the game, leaders must be willing to try, do unconventional things, learn and help mature."
    *   — Ranjit Bawa, Principal, US Chief Strategy and Technology Officer (Context: Advice to clients navigating GenAI transformation.)
*   "Data emerged as the central factor for [our GenAI] success.”
    *   — Former software engineering manager for leading technology company (Context: Emphasizing that while models and computing power exist, accessing the right data is the biggest bottleneck.)
*   "Currently, GenAI adoption is driven by internal demand, with early adopters seeking to use the tools to meet their specific needs. However, we expect a shift towards push-driven adoption in the next year, where all business units will be required to integrate the platform as it becomes an approved and proven tool. This shift will create pressure for teams to leverage the technology or risk missing out on the benefits it offers."
