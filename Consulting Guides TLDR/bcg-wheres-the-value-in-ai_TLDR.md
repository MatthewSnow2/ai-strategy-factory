    *   **AI Stagnating**: Companies taking minimal or no AI action, lacking foundational capabilities, and not generating value.
    *   **AI Emerging**: Companies that have developed foundational capabilities and started initial experimentation but struggle to generate value.
    *   **AI Scaling**: Companies that have systematically developed and are effectively scaling AI capabilities while beginning to generate value.
    *   **AI Future-Built**: Companies at the forefront of AI innovation, systematically building cutting-edge AI capabilities across functions to scale and consistently generate substantial value.
    *   **Leaders**: A group comprising "AI scaling" and "AI future-built" companies (totaling 26% of firms studied), which consistently outperform others.
*   **Six Differentiating Characteristics of AI Leaders**:
    1.  Focus on core business processes as well as support functions.
    2.  Are more ambitious in their AI goals.
    3.  Invest strategically in a few high-priority opportunities to scale value.
