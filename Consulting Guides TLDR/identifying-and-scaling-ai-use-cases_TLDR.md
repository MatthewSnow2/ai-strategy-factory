    2.  **Teaching employees fundamental use cases:** Training teams on core AI applications to speed up discovery.
    3.  **Collecting and prioritizing use cases:** Focusing on opportunities with the biggest business impact.
*   **Key Principles for Finding New Use Cases:**
    1.  AI initiatives should be **led and encouraged by leadership**.
    2.  Empowering employees to find use cases is a faster path to success than focusing on complex ones.
    3.  Encouraging adoption with **hackathons, use case workshops, and peer-led learning sessions** acts as a catalyst.
*   **AI Super-Assistants:** A conceptualization of AI as tireless, focused, always-available assistants that augment employee skills across tasks.
*   **Three Key Areas for AI Impact (Common Workplace Challenges):** Focus points for identifying potential AI use cases.
    1.  **Repetitive low value tasks**
    2.  **Skill bottlenecks**
    3.  **Navigating ambiguity**
*   **Six Simple AI Use Cases (Primitives):** Fundamental types of AI applications applicable across departments and disciplines, derived from analyzing over 600 customer use cases.
    1.  **Content creation:** Summarizing, generating drafts, editing, proofreading, applying style/tone, translating, repurposing content.
    2.  **Research:** Quick learning, searching the web, comprehensive multi-step research, analyzing internal documents, with customizable output formats.
    3.  **Coding:** Debugging, generating first-draft code, porting code, "rubber-ducking," enabling non-coders to write scripts, queries, or visualizations.
    4.  **Data analysis:** Harmonizing data, identifying insights/trends, working with complex spreadsheets without advanced skills, interpreting visual charts, formatting output.
    5.  **Ideation and strategy:** Brainstorming, structuring documents, troubleshooting strategy, providing feedback, multimodal interaction, building strategic plans based on complex inputs.
    6.  **Automations:** Identifying and offloading repeatable, routine tasks (simple or complex) to AI using **memory** and **custom instructions**, shared via **Custom GPTs**.
*   **Estée Lauder's GPT Lab Development Process:** A 5-step repeatable process for developing high-impact GPTs.
    1.  **Design:** Business user defines purpose, scope, audience in a two-page brief.
    2.  **Prepare:** Subject Matter Expert (SME) gathers relevant data.
    3.  **Build and Test:** Tech lead builds, integrates data, and tests.
    4.  **Launch:** Full team deploys and creates a user guide.
    5.  **Pivot and Scale:** Team iterates and optimizes based on feedback.
*   **Impact/Effort Framework:** A quadrant model used to prioritize AI use cases based on their value to the company (impact) and the degree of effort required.
    *   **High ROI focus (High Value, Low Effort):** Quick wins, ideal starting point.
    *   **Self-service (Low Value, Low Effort):** Personal assistant tasks, often individual, but can scale.
    *   **High-value/high-effort:** Transformational, but resource-intensive; pursue after building momentum with quick wins.
    *   **High-effort/low-impact:** Deprioritize, but re-evaluate as AI capabilities advance.
*   **Department Workflow Mapping:** A strategy to embed AI across multi-step workflows, rather than just individual tasks, preparing for AI agents to complete entire projects.
*   **3 Steps to Kickstart AI Adoption:**
    1.  Understand where AI adds value.
    2.  Teach employees fundamental use cases.
    3.  Prioritize what to scale using the Impact/Effort Framework.

## Critical Statistics & Data Points
*   **39%** of U.S. adults have already used AI in its first two years (compared to **20%** adoption for the internet in the same timeframe).
*   **BCG Study (last 3 years):** AI leaders saw **1.5x faster revenue growth**, **1.6x higher shareholder returns**, and **1.4x better return on invested capital** than less advanced peers.
*   **McKinsey Study:** **92%** of companies plan to increase their investment in AI.
*   **McKinsey Study:** Only **1%** of companies believed their AI investments had reached full maturity.
*   **Promega Case Study:** Saved **135 hours** in the first six months using ChatGPT Enterprise.
*   **Indeed Case Study:** Saw a **20% increase** in job applications started by automating job recommendation explanations (after months of testing).
*   **62%** of AI's value lies in core business functions.

## Actionable Insights
*   **Focus on AI for Higher-Value Work:** Leverage AI to free employees for more strategic tasks, skill expansion, and career advancement.
*   **Target Common Workplace Challenges:** Identify AI opportunities in repetitive low-value tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous problems.
*   **Source Use Cases from Employees:**
    *   Ask teams to list scenarios where they struggle to start, spend time on low-value work ("anti-to-do list"), or hit skill bottlenecks (e.g., data analysis, design, writing, web dev).
    *   Use these lists for workshops, hackathons, or company-wide competitions.
    *   Suggest a ChatGPT prompt: "I am a [role] at [company]. We recently implemented ChatGPT at our organization. What are the best use cases for my role?"
*   **Train Teams on AI Primitives:** Teach employees the six fundamental AI use cases (Content creation, Automation, Research, Ideation/strategy, Coding, Data analysis) with department-specific examples.
*   **Collect and Prioritize Use Cases:**
    *   Set up a spreadsheet or Slack channel to gather all proposed use cases.
    *   Promote the **Impact/Effort Framework** company-wide for prioritization in team meetings.
    *   For high-value, high-effort use cases, consider deploying a **Custom GPT** as a scoping tool.
    *   Encourage leaders to champion use cases that impact entire departments.
    *   Re-evaluate use case scoring quarterly, as AI capabilities evolve and may reduce effort.
*   **Encourage Workflow Integration:** Guide power users to break down workflows into individual tasks, identify primitives, and map each step to embed AI from start to finish.
