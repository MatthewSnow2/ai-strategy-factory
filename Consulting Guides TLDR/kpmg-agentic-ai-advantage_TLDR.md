## Comprehensive Cheat Sheet: Agentic AI Advantage

### Key Concepts & Frameworks
*   **Behavioral Change Approaches for AI Adoption**: Instead of traditional top-down methods (upskilling, training, performance metrics, accountability), companies should explore approaches featuring role-modelling, peer-to-peer learning, and psychological safety as key ingredients for successful AI integration.
*   **Trusted AI Principles**: Core tenets for AI implementation, encompassing transparency, explainability, data privacy, and compliance, which are even more critical for autonomous AI agents.
*   **Human-on-the-loop**: A governance principle for autonomous AI agents where humans supervise and monitor the process, having the authority to intervene and override the system if necessary, rather than directly approving every action. This differs from "human-in-the-loop," where a human is between AI advice and the action taken.
*   **Agent Acquisition Strategies (Build, Buy, or Partner)**: Three primary options for organizations to source AI agents:
    *   **Build**: Tailor custom solutions in-house for maximum customization, control, and IP ownership, requiring deep expertise.
    *   **Buy**: Acquire pre-built agents from vendors for rapid execution, efficiency, and access to proven solutions, though with limited customization.
    *   **Partner**: Collaborate with external AI experts to develop and implement agents, leveraging their expertise while sharing risk and cost, though with less control than building.
*   **Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A set of standards and a platform that facilitates seamless agent-to-agent communication and continuous connection with external information sources, tools, and services, eliminating the need for custom integrations.
*   **A2A standards (Agent-to-Agent communication standards)**: Protocols, such as Google's emerging framework, that provide a standardized basis for secure, explainable, and auditable interactions between agents, enabling multi-agent task orchestration and dynamic role assignment.
*   **KPMG TACO Framework™**: A tool mentioned for identifying appropriate types of AI agents and departments/processes for agentic AI applications.
*   **AI System Cards**: Documentation that serves as a single, authoritative source for the results of AI system evaluations, detailing intended use, data considerations, components, and limitations.
*   **Purple Teams**: Teams that conduct rigorous offensive testing and defensive evaluation for AI systems before production launch to ensure robustness and security.
